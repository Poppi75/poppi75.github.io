        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Johannes, but people call me Poppi. 
            I'm a 17 year old game, web and software developer from Finland. 
            I've been into games for years. 
            I got my interest in gaming through YouTube and I started playing with different consoles, like the PlayStation. 
            The Nintendo Wii was also one of the most important consoles for me, still today. 
            I also like mobile gaming. 
            After a while I got interested in PC's and PC gaming. 
            I bought my first gaming PC when I was 12 years old and since that, I've been into developing. 
            Recently, I upgraded my first PC completely. 
            The only parts that I didn't by new, were the case and the SSD's.</p>

            I love learning in this field and I want to get better day by day. 
            I have insane amounts of motivation to learn new things and improve my skills even in my freetime. 
            I'm currently learning C++ through my school team's Unreal VR project.
